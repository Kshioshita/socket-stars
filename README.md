#Assignment 4
##Collaborative Stargazing
For this assignment I extended my interactive drawing, Stargazing, so that multiple users can create constellations together. When a user generates stars, all other users will also be able to see the same placement of stars. Users are then able to create constellations by connecting stars, which also will be viewed by all the other users. Each time someone conects, they are given a shade of yellow which also helps distinguish which lines were made by each user.
